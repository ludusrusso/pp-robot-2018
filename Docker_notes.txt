---------------------- CONTAINERS VS VIRTUAL_MACHINES -----------------------

* A CONTAINER is an abstraction at the app layer. Multiple containers can run
    on the same machine sharing the same OS Kernel. They take less space (MBs)
    and start almost immediately.

* A VM is an abstraction of the physical hw. Bigger images since each VM includes
    also the code of the operating system (GBs), and they are slower to boot.

---------------------------- IMAGE VS CONTAINER ------------------------------

* An Image is static, it is a photography of the system at a certain instant
  (it is like a Class in an object oriented language).
  Stack of only readable (RO) layers.

* A Container is the instance of the image after having worked on it
  (it is like an Object instantiated from that Class).
  Same stack of layers (RO), but with a writable (RW) layer on top.
  Surposing all these layers, the final content of the container is obtained.

------------------------------- IMAGE LAYERS --------------------------------

* An Image can be composed by different layers, which superposed compose the
target image.
Layers are immutable (cannot be modified, only readable) and can be shared by
multiple images (if more than one image contains the same layer, the disk
occupation will consists in the size of the single layer). Called IMAGE LAYERS

* When a container is instantiated, a new single writable layer is created on
top of all other layers. All modifications to the container are saved within
this layer. Called CONTAINER LAYER

-------------------------------- FILE SYSTEM --------------------------------

* From a file system p.o.w. each container is completely isolated from the
  main file system and the file systems of each other container.

    EX : If i create a folder (mkdir dir) in a container than i put it in background
          and i run another container, i will not able to see the 'dir' created
          in the other container.

* HOW TO SHARE FILES BETWEEN HOST AND A CONTAINER ?

    The solution is to use a -- DATA VOLUME --
    I can bridge in this way the container filesystem with the file system of
    of the underlying operating system.

    To create a data volume is necessary to pass the flag -v to the command
    'docker run' and specifying a local path (optional, but recommended) and
    a container path.

      $ docker run -it -v /home/edospi20/Desktop/Data_Volume/:/var ubuntu /bin/bash

--------------------------------- NETWORKING ---------------------------------

If the container is running over a VM there is no direct way to communicate
with the HTTP demon, which is blind within its container.
We need so to know the ip address of the virtual machine :

    $ docker-machine ip
    192.168.99.100

We cannot directly access to that address (http://192.168.99.100), but it is
required to map to a VM port the port from which the HTTP demon answer :

    $ docker run -d -p 8088:80 httpd:2.4

      The web server httpd:2.4 downloaded from the repository is made run in
      a background container and with -p option all calls done on port 8088
      of the virtual machine (the standard 192.168.99.100) are mapped to port
      80  of the container.
      Now pointing to http://192.168.99.100:8088: we will have the container
      answering correctly.

-------------------------------- DOCKERFILE ----------------------------------

It is a textual file used to modify the original images (templates) to create
our customized images. Group of instructions used to define a Docker Image.
The Docker Engine will be in charge of validating the Dockerfile and generating
the new image starting from it.
In general this is the file which is loaded in github such that having a compact
way to reconstruct a customized image in a unique file.

              ------------ DOCKERFILE INSTRUCTIONS -----------

* FROM *

    It allows to specify the Base Image from where to start to create the
    customized one.
    We have 3 possibilities, as if working from command line :

      FROM <image_name>
      FROM <image_name>:<tag>
      FROM <image_name>@<hash>

* ENV *

    To set environmental variables valid for the whole execution context of
    a Dockerfile.

      ENV <key>=<value>

    Within the Dockerfile, in order to recover the value of the variable the
    character $ is used (i.e. $key).

* RUN *

    To execute commands in the image we are going to generate (i.e. install a
    package). Two formats can be used :

      # shell form (uses OS shell facilities)
      RUN <comando> <parametro1> ... <parametroN>

      # exec form (uses OS primitives only)
      RUN ["<comando>", "<parametro1>", ... , "<parametroN>"]

    NOTE_THAT : Each RUN command generate a new image layer wrapping the
                modifications introduced by the command itself. Thus, the father
                image remains untouched.

                => It is good practice to collapse correlated commands within
                    the same RUN instruction.

* ADD and COPY *

    Used to move files and directory from the build context (local host path, where
    the Dockerfile is) to the Filesystem of the created image.
    Two ways to use command ADD :

      # shell form
      ADD <src> <dest>

      # exec form
      ADD ["<src>", "<dest>"]

    The <dest> path can be absolute or relative w.r.t. the current working
    directory (WORKDIR). More than one <src> path can be specified and this can
    be : file, directory or URL addresses.

    COPY instruction has the same effect of ADD, but it provides no support
    for remote files or archives. Anyway using COPY is preferable if it is
    not required to work with remote files and archives.

* ENTRYPOINT *

    It allows to execute a command within the container as soon as it is started.
    The difference w.r.t. RUN is that in this case the effects of the instruction
    affects the container itself and not the image generating it.

      # shell form
      ENTRYPOINT <comando> <parametro_1> ... <parametro_n>

      # exec form
      ENTRYPOINT ["<comando>", "<parametro_1>", ..., "<parametro_n>"]

    Using the ENTRYPOINT instruction the last part of the command 'docker run'
    will be not a command anymore, but a parameter to pass to the command
    expressed in the ENTRYPOINT.

      EX:
        #Dockerfile (suppose that it generate the image with name 'htmlit')
          FROM ubuntu:precise
          ENTRYPOINT ["ls"]

        #Command line
          $ docker run htmlit -a -l
            => -a -l are the options passed to the command 'ls'.

          $ docker run entrypoint <comand>
            => This will overwrite the behavior of the ENTRYPOINT instruction
                in the docker file.

* CMD *

    It has effect on the Container and does not modify the image, like as
    the ENTRYPOINT instruction. It has two different behaviors if :

      - ENTRYPOINT instruction is not present

        It allows to execute a command within the container as soon as it is started.
        The command specified after CMD is automatically overwritten if in
        the command line another command is specified :

            $ docker run htmlit whoami

          # shell form
          CMD <comando> <parametro_1> ... <parametro_n>

          # exec form
          CMD ["<comando>", "<parametro_1>", ..., "<parametro_n>"]

      - ENTRYPOINT instruction is present

          It allows to provide default parameters to the command expressed
          in the directive ENTRYPOINT

            # exec form (in this case the only possible option)
            CMD ["<parametro_1>", ..., "<parametro_n>"]

          In this way the command ENTRYPOINT will not be overwrittable anymore (unless
          the flag 'entrypoint' is used in the command 'docker run'). All default
          parameters specified in CMD are kept overwrittable.

    One CMD instruction only is admitted in a Dockerfile => Only the last CMD
    is taken into consideration.

* WORKDIR *

    To set the working directory within the Container, wherein the successive
    instructions will have effect.

        # absolute path
        WORKDIR /path1/path2

        # relative path (relative to the previous WORKDIR instruction - root is the default)
        WORKDIR path1/path2

* LABEL *

    Used to add metadata to our image, not directly linked to the definition
    of the image itself.

        LABEL "<chiave>"="<valore>" ...

    Can indicate a version number or an image description and stuffs like that.
    LABEL create a new layer => Better to collapse correlated info.

* EXPOSE *

    To declare on which ports the Container is listening.

        EXPOSE <porta_1> [<porta_n>]

    When the container is started we can use the -P parameter to expose the
    ports declared in the attribute EXPOSE on random ports. With respect to
    -p parameter, now we have not to choose both the container and the host
    port.
    To know on which port the port exposed in the dockerfile has been mapped, it
    is possible to use the instruction :

        $ docker port <exposed port> <container name | container id>

        EX : If in the dockerfile we have exposed 4444 port and the container
              name is htmlit the command will be :

                  $ docker port 4444 htmlit

* VOLUME *

    To make the Host FS communicating with the Container FS.
    This instruction allows to specify a path within the Container FS

        VOLUME ["/www"]

    When the Container is started it is possible to specify which local path is
    associated with the path '/www' defined in the container.


------------------------------ BUILDING IMAGES -------------------------------

Starting from the Dockerfile a command is used to generate the target image.

    $ docker build [OPT ...] <build context>
      Refers to the command section below for major details.

Once the instruction is executed the new image can be found locally within
the PC together with all the other ones and it is possible to see it with
the command 'docker images' or 'docker image ls' as usual.

------------------------------ USEFUL COMMANDS -------------------------------

$ docker images

  REPOSITORY      TAG      IMAGE ID            CREATED          SIZE
  hello-world     latest   c54a2cc56cbb        3 months ago     1.848 kB

    Show images present on our PC.
    REPOSITORY = Container of correlated images (i.e. container of the differ-
    ent versions of hello-world).
    TAG = A version of the image (i.e. hello-world:latest, hello-world:ciao are
    two different version belonging to the same image repository-cathegory)

$ docker pull redis:3.0.0

    3.0.0: Pulling from library/redis

    Status: Downloaded newer image for redis:3.0.0

    To download an image from the web.
    Each Pull Complete identify a different layer composing the overall image.
    Digest = Encrypted content identifying the image. It is a unique ID to
    identify the image (can be substituted to the format repository:tag)

      $ docker pull redis@sha256:06ce8790b8f63ad1ee...370572405cb15508ecdc

    If a layer is Already Present this means that it has been downloaded when
    pulling a previous image.

$ docker ps -a

    CONTAINER ID    IMAGE          COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS   PORTS   NAMES
    c3849603f184    hello-world    "/hello"  3 weeks ago      Exited           trusting_bell
    0017d2a0b9d1    hello-world    "/hello"  6 seconds ago    Exited           boring_turing

    Shows both active and inactive (-a option) containers.

    CONTAINER ID = id of the Container Layer.

$ docker run --name hello_html_it hello-world

    To run a container starting from image hello-world:latest (default) and
    naming it hello_html_it. Without --name a random name is choosen.

    $ docker run -d hello-world (useful for web servers)

      b4ec94bf57023778c0ad191e4626f563cd86edfbb893cb701172e676462fe063

      -d = Container is executed in background

    $ docker logs b4ec9

      To show the output produced in background by the container.
      b4ec = starting value of the hash identifying the container.

$ docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

    root@996fc96427ff:/# ls
    bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var

    To run executables (/bin/bash program) from a container (Ubuntu = ContainerID = 996fc96427ff)

    -it = Redirect standard channels of a container, giving the impression to
          work within it.

          $ root@996fc96427ff:/# exit

            exit command will terminate the interactive mode and so the container
            will be stopped, since no process is contained in it.

          $ CTRL + P + Q

            In order to terminate the interactive mode only.
            This command does not arrest the container which can be reattached
            with the following command:

              $ docker attach 113e7c

                  root@113e7c31aae9:/#

$ docker run -it -v /home/edospi20/Desktop/Data_Volume/:/var ubuntu /bin/bash

  root@b4afd75514bd:/# touch html_it.log

  To create a data volume shared btw the container and the host.
  In this way each file added to the path /var within the container (i.e.
  html_it.log) will be visible in our Ubuntu at path /home/edospi20/Desktop/Data_Volume
  and viceversa.

$ docker rm 113e7c

  To remove the container (Container Layer) created at the execution of the
  command 'docker run'. All sub-Image_Layers are preserved in our hard disk.

  $ docker rm --force 113e7c

    To remove a container already in execution.

$ docker start 113e7c31aae9

    To start a previously stopped container ($ docker stop 113e7c31aae9).
    Needs a 'docker attach' to be brought back to the interactive mode.

$ docker top 113e7c31aae9

    PID                USER             COMMAND
    15635              root             /bin/bash

    To check the container active processes without entering in it.
    The PID instead of being '1' (father process) as if launching the command 'ps'
    within the bash console run in the container, is the real PID assigned to the
    process by the underlying OS.

$ docker build [OPT ...] <build context>

    <build context> = Provides the relative context to the build engine.
                      i.e. : The COPY instruction within the Dockerfile has
                              a mandatory relative path, so the context has to
                              be know for the relative path to be solved.

    -t = Option to assign a tag to out image
    -f = Where to recover the Dockerfile if this is not present in the <build context>

        EX :

            $ docker build -t esempio_1:v1 .
            . = build context
