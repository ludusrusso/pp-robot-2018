(*) stepper_test:
 it contains a code which makes turning the motor at a certain speed.
 In order to change this speed, a change on the setSpeed() function
 argument has to be done.
 Note that: the experienced max speed is around 1023.

(*) rosserial_test:
 it contains a subscriber node to be deployed into arduino.
 The purpose of this code is to create a ros serial communication between 
 arduino and the host PC. In order to do this, the following steps have to
 be followed:

  1) Open a terminal to run: roscore
  2) Open rosserial_test.ino from the arduino IDE
  3) Compile and deploy that code into arduino. At this point the subscriber
     is waiting for messages on the topic "motor_speed_topic"
  4) Open a terminal to run: "rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0"
     note that: ttyACM0 can be different. It is the serial port at which arduino
                has been connected.
  5) Open a new terminal to run: 
	rostopic pub motor_speed_topic std_msgs/Int16 "data: 1023" --once
     With this command the host PC (publisher) has published on the topic and the 
     motor should turn at that speed (in the example above 1023).

 Issue: setSpeed() function (inside motor_run_Cb() function) can not receive a
	variable parameter at the moment.

 Next goal: Create a new msg type for the topic that involves more than one info as:
	- speed
	- direction of rotation
	- # of rotations
	- ...
