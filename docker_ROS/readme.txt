OPEN ISSUE:
	- armv7/armhf-ubuntu:16.04 is the starting image form which we build ours. This architecture seems to work both for
	  raspberrypi 2 and 3. The problem, though, is at build time, when we successfully build only on a MAC machine.
	  Further tests will be carried out on different starting architecture images and working machines
