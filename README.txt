INSTALL AND REMOVE DOCKER:

Automatically install docker-ce:

    $ curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    $ sudo sh get-docker.sh

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

    $ sudo usermod -aG docker your-user

Remember to log out and back in for this to take effect!


Uninstall the Docker CE package:

$ sudo apt-get purge docker-ce
Images, containers, volumes, or customized configuration files on your host are not automatically removed. To delete all images, containers, and volumes:

$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
You must delete any edited configuration files manually.

        About:
            * Dokerfile: - Must create a new EMPTY FOLDER, change directory to this folder and here create the Dokerfile
                         - This file defines the behavior of the container after the build process
                         - NOTE the ADD command which can be very useful to copy our ROS_ws in the container
            * Build: - inside the dockerfile folder issue the build command:

                                $ docker build -t "user_name/repo_name:image_tag" .

                     - Note the . at the end meaning to build from dockerfile in this folder
            * docker-compose: - Allows us to define services, it "say how the image will run"
                              - docker-compose.yml file is what we write to specify how the container should behave
                              - to run the service:

                                $ docker-compose run name_of_service bash

    Docker volumes:
    https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/

        About:
            "Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
            While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker"
        Experienced:
            We tried to use volumes, but we had some troubles.
            MAC: the volumes seems to be not directly accessible by mac filesystem, since docker is running inside a VM.
                 So, the path returned by "docker volume inspect volume_name" is relative to the VM and not to the MAC.
                 SOLUTION: use BIND MOUNTING, which provide almost same capabilities of volumes, but the shared folder refers
                            to the host filesystem
                            https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/
                            To mount a shared folder inside a docker container:

                                $ docker run --rm -it -v ~/docker_ROS/ros_ws:/mnt/ros_volume pfrancesco/rpi2:updated

                            This command performs:
                                run the pfrancesco/rpi2:updated image
                                -- rm: automatically remove the container once we exit from it
                                -v: mount the ros_ws folder inside /mnt/ros_volume folder in the container

BASIC COMMANDS:
    $ docker run --rm -it pfrancesco/rpi2:updated bash
    $ docker build -t "pfrancesco/rpi2:new_tag" .
    $ docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q) (to close all opened containers)
    $ docker run --rm -it -v ~/docker_ROS/ros_ws:/mnt/ros_volume pfrancesco/rpi2:updated (to run and mount the shared folder)
